# The Intersection of Business and Technology

The most valuable professionals I've encountered aren't just business-savvy or technically skilled—they operate effectively at the intersection of both. This hybrid perspective has been crucial in every successful project I've worked on.

## Why Technical Depth Matters for Business

Understanding technology isn't about being able to code (though it helps). It's about:

- **Recognizing what's possible**: You can't propose solutions you don't understand
- **Estimating realistic timelines**: Technical complexity directly impacts business planning
- **Communicating effectively**: Bridge the gap between business requirements and technical implementation

## Why Business Context Makes Better Tech

The best technical solutions solve real business problems. When building Argus, the research agent, understanding the business need for consistent, comprehensive research output shaped every technical decision—from the evaluation framework to the caching strategy.

## The Compound Effect

This intersection creates opportunities that pure business or pure technical roles miss. You can identify business problems that technology can solve AND architect technical solutions that serve business goals.

The result is systems that not only work but drive meaningful business impact.
