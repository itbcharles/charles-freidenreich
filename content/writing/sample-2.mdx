# Building Systems That Scale

Building scalable systems isn't just about handling more users—it's about creating foundations that can evolve with changing business needs. Through projects like Argus and Zeno, I've developed principles that help systems scale both technically and operationally.

## Core Principles

**Modularity First**: Every component should be replaceable and testable in isolation. This isn't just good engineering; it's good business sense.

**Observable Everything**: If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. Build logging, metrics, and monitoring into every system from day one.

**Fail Fast, Recover Faster**: Design for failure scenarios from the beginning, not as an afterthought.

## Real-World Application

When building research automation tools, these principles meant the difference between a script that works once and a system that reliably processes hundreds of research requests daily.

The investment in proper architecture pays dividends when business requirements inevitably change.
